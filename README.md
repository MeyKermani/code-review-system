# Code Review System

## Overview
This project consists of two services built using FastAPI:
1. **Service 1 LLM Service**: Handles connection to gpt4 and deepseek you can choose any of them from the .env file in service 1.
Service 1 is responsible for handling requests to the LLM model and returning the generated text. And also this 
service provides an endpoint to analyze the code using the LLM models.
2. **Service 2 Code Analysis**: Manages downloading asynchronously git repos and analyzing the functions via calling service1 API.

Both services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Docker Compose for easy deployment and scalability.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: A modern Python web framework for building APIs.
  - Chosen for its speed, simplicity, and built-in support for OpenAPI documentation.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for its rich ecosystem and compatibility with FastAPI.

### Containerization
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments for running services.
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies orchestration of multiple services, networking, and volume management.

---

## Design Choices
1. **Microservice Architecture**:
   - Each service is independent and focuses on specific functionality. This makes scaling and maintenance easier.
2. **Docker**:
   - Simplifies deployment and ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
3. **RESTful API Design**:
   - Enables clear, predictable endpoints for clients to interact with the services.
4. **Volumes**:
   - Persistent storage is implemented for Service 2 to ensure files downloaded during runtime are saved permanently.
5. **Networking**:
   - Services communicate via Docker Compose using service names.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeyKermani/code-review-system.git
   cd code-review-system
   docker-compose up --build

## API Endpoints

### Service 1 Endpoint

#### **POST `/analyze`**
**Description**: Gives suggestion for function improvement.

**Request**:
```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/analyze' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data ' {"function_code": "def add(a,b): return a+b"}'
```
**Response**:

{

    "suggestions": "The function you provided is a simple and correct implementation of adding two numbers. However, there are a few suggestions to improve readability, maintainability, and robustness:\n\n### 1. **Add Type Hints**\n   - Adding type hints makes the function more readable and helps with static type checking tools like `mypy`.\n\n   ```python\n   def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n       return a + b\n   ```\n\n   If you want the function to handle floats as well:\n\n   ```python\n   from typing import Union\n\n   def add(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]:\n       return a + b\n   ```\n\n### 2. **Add a Docstring**\n   - Adding a docstring helps other developers (or your future self) understand what the function does.\n\n   ```python\n   def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n       \"\"\"Add two integers and return"
}

### Service 2 Endpoints

#### **POST `/analyze/start`**
**Description**: Gets a repo URL and asynchronously downloads the repo.

**Request**:
```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8002/analyze/start' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "repo_url": "https://github.com/KeithGalli/python-api-example"
}'
```
**Response**:
```
{
 "job_id": "4776c78d-5098-4f51-a739-bacb0d7f30ae"
}
```

#### **POST `/analyze/function`**
**Description**: From the downloaded repo, analyzes the functions and sends them to Service 1 for suggestions.

**Request**:
```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8002/analyze/function' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "job_id":"4776c78d-5098-4f51-a739-bacb0d7f30ae",
  "function_name": "book_review.add_record"
}'
```
**Response**:

"suggestions": "Here are a few suggestions to improve the given Python function:\n\n1. **Add a docstring**: Provide a clear description of what the function does, its parameters, and its return values. This improves readability and maintainability.\n\n2. **Use `and` instead of `or`**: Since both keys are required, the condition should check if both keys are missing, not just one.\n\n3. **Return a meaningful value**: Instead of returning `False`, consider raising an exception or returning a more descriptive value to indicate why the function failed.\n\n4. **Add type hints**: Type hints make the function more readable and help catch potential errors early.\n\n5. **Improve readability**: Even though you asked to ignore indentation and line breaks, proper formatting is crucial for readability.\n\nHereâ€™s the improved version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef add_record(data: dict) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds a record if the input dictionary contains both 'Book' and 'Rating' keys.\n\n"
